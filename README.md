X-O Game (also known as Tic-Tac-Toe) is a simple two-player game where players 
take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid with either an "X" or an "O". The goal 
is to place three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
before your opponent does. The game can be implemented in a variety of programming
languages and platforms, from basic console applications to more sophisticated web-based 
versions. It is a popular beginner project for those learning to code and can serve as a good 
introduction to game development concepts such as game logic, user input, and winner determination.
